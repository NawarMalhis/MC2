# MoRFchibi 2.0
Molecular Recognition Features (MoRFs) are a subset of protein-binding IDR that undergo a disorder-to-order transition upon binding. MoRFchibi 2.0 is a specialized prediction tool designed to identify the locations of MoRFs within protein sequences. Output scores are generated using an ensemble of convolutional neural network logistic regression models, followed by a reverse Bayes Rule to adjust for priors in the training data. These scores reflect MoRF probabilities normalized for the priors in the training data, making them individually interpretable and compatible with other tools utilizing the same scoring framework, such as IPA.
